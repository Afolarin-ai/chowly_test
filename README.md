# Chowly

A table-side ordering platform for a restaurant: customers order and pay from
their table, waiters pick up orders and record which chef or bartender
prepared each item, and every order carries its own waiting time, rating,
complaint, and payment record.

**Live app:** https://chowly-9hem.onrender.com/

## 1. How It Was Built

### Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) + SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database:** SQLite for local development, PostgreSQL in production (the app
  reads a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and falls back to SQLite if it
  isn't set — same codebase, no branching logic needed)
- **Frontend:** vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no framework. Served as
  static files by the same FastAPI process, so the whole app is one
  deployable service and one live link.
- **Deployment:** Render (web service) + Neon (managed Postgres), wired
  together with `render.yaml`

One service instead of a separate frontend/backend deploy was a deliberate
call given the timeline — it halves the moving parts without giving up a
real, polished UI.

### Data model, as finally implemented
This build's model is a direct implementation of the entities from the
prior engineered-model assignment, carried through unchanged: `Customer`,
`Restaurant`, `Menu`, `MenuItem`, `Waiter`, `Chef`, `Bartender`, `Order`,
`OrderItem`, `OrderPreparation`, `Complaint`, `Rating`, and `Payment`.

| Table | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `Customer` | first_name, last_name, phone_number (optional, unique when given), email, date_registered |
| `Restaurant` | name, address, phone_number, email |
| `Menu` | restaurant_id, name, menu_type, description |
| `MenuItem` | menu_id, item_name, item_type (food/drink), price, prep_time_minutes, availability_status |
| `Waiter` / `Chef` / `Bartender` | restaurant_id, first_name, last_name, phone_number |
| `Order` | customer_id, restaurant_id, waiter_id, table_number, status (placed/assigned/served/paid/cancelled), order_time, actual_completion_time |
| `OrderItem` | order_id, menu_item_id, quantity, unit_price |
| `OrderPreparation` | order_id, order_item_id, menu_item_id, chef_id, bartender_id, status, preparation_start/end_time |
| `Complaint` | order_id, customer_id, description, complaint_date, status |
| `Rating` | order_id, customer_id, rating_value (1-5), comment, rating_date |
| `Payment` | order_id, customer_id, amount, payment_method, payment_time, status, transaction_reference |

**Three deliberate deviations remain, each forced by the build itself,**
per the instruction to change the model where the build requires it and
say why:

- **No `CustomerID`-based login.** The assignment explicitly states,
  "logins are not required, a simple switch is enough." `Customer` still
  exists as a real table — a customer's name is captured at order time.
- **A single seeded `Restaurant` and `Menu`.** The original model supports
  many restaurants, each with their own menu. This build is a single
  restaurant's ordering system (Chowly deployed for one restaurant, not a
  multi-tenant platform serving many), so one `Restaurant` row and one
  `Menu` row are seeded at startup and everything else hangs off them.
  The foreign keys are still there — a second restaurant could be added
  without a schema change — there's just no UI for restaurant selection.
- **`estimated_waiting_time` is derived, not stored.** It's computed as
  the slowest single item in the order (max of each item's
  `prep_time_minutes`), not entered or stored as a free field on `Order`,
  because a kitchen and bar work in parallel rather than making items one
  after another — and because deriving it means it can never drift out of
  sync with what's actually on the order.

`OrderPreparation` is implemented exactly as originally modelled: one row
per order item, referencing either a chef or a bartender depending on
whether the item is food or a drink. A waiter picks up an order (setting
`Order.waiter_id`), then records a preparer for each item individually —
the API rejects a chef on a drink item or a bartender on a food item.
Serving an order is blocked until every item's preparation is complete.

`Rating` and `Complaint` are separate, independent actions, matching the
original model's separate tables — a customer can rate an order without
complaining, or complain without rating, and each can only be filed once
per order.

### Deployment
Render (web service) reads `render.yaml` and builds directly from the
GitHub repository; Neon provides a managed Postgres database via a
`DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Full step-by-step deployment
instructions are in Section 6 of this document.

## 2. How AI Was Used

This app was built working turn-by-turn with Claude (Anthropic), in an
agentic coding environment with real file access and a live server —
not just a chat that suggested snippets.

### What I asked for
A working build of the Chowly assignment end-to-end — API, frontend,
deployment packaging — prioritizing a polished, non-templated visual
design over speed.

### How it went, across several passes
1. Claude first designed a simplified schema from scratch (no separate
   Customer/Restaurant/Menu tables, chef/bartender fields bolted directly
   onto `Order`, complaint and rating merged into one entity) because it
   didn't have my original engineered-model document in front of it.
2. I supplied that document, and Claude reconciled the build against it —
   restructuring the tables, rewriting the API's assignment flow from a
   single order-level action into a two-step "pick up the order, then
   record a preparer per item" flow, and splitting rating and complaint
   back into two independent actions. I chose to spend the extra time on
   this rather than keep the simplified version, specifically so the
   submitted model matches the one I was graded on designing.
3. I asked for a first visual pass — a logo, generated staff avatars, and
   motion. Claude used hand-illustrated SVG icons for menu items at this
   stage, since it didn't have real photos yet.
4. I supplied real photography for every dish plus two venue shots.
   Claude swapped the illustrated icons for the actual photos, added a
   background photo treatment behind the app, and — separately, based on
   my own read of the ordering flow — dropped the phone number field
   from checkout since it added friction with no benefit in a no-login
   app.
5. I asked for the visual design to be pushed further — bolder fonts,
   more saturated color, and backgrounds that were visible rather than
   washed almost flat. Claude resaturated the palette, swapped the body
   font, and rebuilt how the background photos stay legible (frosted
   panels instead of a heavy wash).
6. I asked for the "assigned" order status to be split into two distinct
   labels — "Assigned to a waiter" versus "Order is being prepared" —
   once I noticed the single "Being prepared" label didn't distinguish
   between a waiter just picking up an order and a chef/bartender
   actually starting on it. Claude computed this from whether any
   `OrderPreparation` row was complete yet, rather than adding a new
   stored status value, since it's fully derivable from existing state.
7. Given the assignment's bonus prompt, I added five features (cancel an
   order, 86 an item, a small stats panel, table QR codes, printable
   tickets).
8. I found five real, separate bugs, each fixed in its own pass: qty
   buttons and form fields were invisible in dark mode (form controls
   don't inherit page text color by default in browsers); the rail's
   spike-hole was invisible because it was being silently clipped away
   by the ticket's own torn-edge clip-path, not a color problem; rating
   stars and typed complaint text were being wiped every ~6 seconds by
   the background poll rebuilding the whole page; the same issue also
   reset the chef/bartender dropdown before a waiter could hit Record;
   and the waiter stats panel was counting cancelled orders toward
   "orders today" and even letting a cancelled order win "top seller."
9. I flagged that most of the food photos looked oddly zoomed in and
   cropped. The cause: the original uploads were mostly tall portrait
   shots, force-cropped to a landscape 4:3 card at upload time — for the
   suya platter specifically, that crop had kept only about half the
   photo's height. Reprocessed every dish photo from the original
   uploads at a 4:5 portrait ratio matching how they were actually shot.

### What I accepted
- The overall architecture (single FastAPI service serving both API and
  static frontend, SQLite→Postgres via one env var).
- The visual design direction at each stage — the ticket-style order
  cards, the illustrated-icon system before I had real photos, and later
  the photo-and-frosted-panel treatment — each proposed specifically to
  avoid the generic "AI-generated SaaS card" look.
- The three named deviations from my original model (no login, single
  restaurant/menu, derived rather than stored waiting time) — Claude
  flagged these as forced by the assignment's actual feature list rather
  than silently dropping them, and I agreed with the reasoning for each.
- Computing the "Assigned to a waiter" / "Order is being prepared" split
  from existing preparation data instead of adding a new stored status.
- The fix approach for every bug in pass 8 — a shared "draft" pattern
  for anything a poll could wipe (rating, complaint, chef/bartender
  selection) rather than a one-off fix per form, and a status filter in
  the stats queries rather than hiding cancelled orders from the
  database entirely.

### What I corrected / rejected
- Rejected the first data model outright — even though it worked, it
  wasn't the one I'd actually designed and been graded on, so I had it
  fully restructured to match my original document rather than accept
  the shortcut version.
- Rejected phone number as a required field once I saw it sitting in
  the actual checkout flow — it added friction for no real benefit in
  an app with no login, so I had it dropped and made properly optional
  on the backend, not just hidden in the UI.
- Pushed back on the single "Being prepared" status label as
  ambiguous — a waiter picking up an order and a chef actually starting
  to cook are two different moments, and I wanted the label to say
  which one had actually happened.
- Rejected the first visual pass as too safe — illustrated icons, a
  muted palette, background photos washed almost to invisibility. Asked
  for real dish photography, then a second time for bolder fonts, more
  saturated color, and backgrounds that were actually visible rather
  than decorative.
- Rejected the first version of the kitchen rail — the ticket sat too
  far from the rail bar (a 26px gap) with a spike-hole too small and
  too subtle to read as connected to anything. Asked directly "is this
  how the hanger feature is supposed to work?" rather than assuming it
  was intentional, which is what prompted the actual clip-path bug to
  get found.
- Rejected the Food/Drinks section headers as too small (21px) to read
  as real section dividers, and asked what else should change rather
  than just accepting a single size bump.

### What I verified myself
- Every screen and the full order lifecycle (place → assign → per-item
  preparation → serve → rate/complain → pay) was tested by clicking
  through the running app — not just reading the code — both before and
  after the model reconciliation, since the rewrite touched every layer
  of the stack.
- Walked through the actual Neon database setup and Render deployment
  myself rather than taking the instructions on faith — along the way I
  caught that my extracted project was missing its `.git` folder (my
  file manager was just hiding dotfiles, not a real bug) and confirmed
  the fix before moving on.
- Noticed independently that the documentation had gone stale after a
  run of feature commits, by checking it against the actual commit
  history rather than assuming it was current.
- Flagged things that looked off during my own use of the app — an
  apparent missing waiting-time display, and a report of orders looking
  duplicated on the customer page — rather than assuming everything was
  fine. The first turned out to be a screenshot-tool artifact, confirmed
  against the live DOM state, not a real bug; the second I chose to
  deprioritize rather than chase down immediately, and it's noted as an
  open item in Section 4 instead of being quietly dropped.
- I caught, through my own use of the app, that the kitchen rail's
  hanger effect wasn't visually working, that rating/complaint forms
  and the chef/bartender picker were losing input to the background
  poll, and that the stats panel was counting cancelled orders — five
  separate real bugs, each confirmed fixed before moving on.

## 3. The Specific Behaviour of the Application

### Menu browsing
A customer opens the app and lands on the Customer tab by default. Food
and drinks are shown in separate sections, each item listing its name,
price, and prep time — loaded from the database at startup via
`Restaurant` → `Menu` → `MenuItem`, not hardcoded in the frontend.

### Order placement
The customer enters their name and table number, adjusts quantities
with the +/− controls on each item, and a cart bar appears at the
bottom showing the running item count and total. Pressing Place Order
looks up or creates their `Customer` record, creates the `Order` and
its `OrderItem` rows, and creates one `OrderPreparation` row per item
(unassigned). The customer immediately sees an order ticket with its
status, itemised total, and estimated waiting time.

### Order assignment
Switching to the Waiter tab shows every unpaid order. A waiter selects
their own name once (remembered for the session). Pressing Assign to Me
on a new order records that waiter against the order (`Order.waiter_id`)
and reveals a preparation checklist — one row per item. Each row shows
a chef selector for food items or a bartender selector for drinks
(never both), because the preparer is recorded per item, not once for
the whole order. The order's status label reads "Assigned to a waiter"
until at least one item has an actual chef or bartender recorded, at
which point it switches to "Order is being prepared" — both are derived
from existing data, not a separate stored status. Mark Served only
appears once every row is checked off.

### Complaint and rating
Once an order is being prepared or later, the customer's ticket grows
two independent, optional forms: a star rating (1–5, with an optional
comment) and a free-text complaint. Either, both, or neither can be
submitted — each is stored as its own record and can only be filed once
per order.

### Payment
Once an order is marked served, both the customer's ticket and the
waiter's dashboard show a Pay (Pretend) button — either side can record
it, matching "payment is made on the platform just before the customer
exits." Paying creates a `Payment` row with a generated transaction
reference, explicitly labelled pretend, marks the order paid, and moves
it to the waiter's "Settled tonight" list.

### Real storage
Every action above is a write to the database (Postgres in production).
Refreshing the page, or coming back later, doesn't lose anything — the
customer's own orders are remembered by browser (order IDs kept in
`localStorage`, since there's no login), and the waiter dashboard
re-fetches the full current order list from the server on every load.

---

## 4. Bonus — Beyond the Requirements

The assignment calls out bonus points for anything built beyond the
core requirements. Everything below is additional; none of it is
needed for the required story to work.

### Cancel an order
A customer can cancel from their ticket while it's still genuinely just
sitting in the queue — either nobody's picked it up yet (placed), or a
waiter has but no chef/bartender has actually started on any item
(assigned, with every `OrderPreparation` still pending). The instant
real prep work begins on even one item, the Cancel button disappears —
cancelling at that point would mean wasting food already being made.
The backend enforces the same rule independently (rejects with a 400 if
called too late), so this isn't just a hidden UI button.

### 86 an item
A waiter can mark any menu item sold out from a small "Menu
availability" panel on the Floor screen. This flips
`MenuItem.availability_status`, which already existed in the original
data model but wasn't wired to anything until now. A sold-out item
disappears from the customer's menu within one polling cycle (the app
already refreshes every few seconds) — no page reload needed.

### Today's numbers
The waiter dashboard shows a small live panel: revenue today, order
count, the top-selling item, and the average rating — all computed from
data the app already has (`Payment`, `OrderItem`, `Rating`), scoped to
the current date.

### Table QR codes
Every table gets a generated QR code encoding a link straight back to
the ordering page with that table pre-filled, plus a printable sheet of
them for however many tables the restaurant has — print it, cut it up,
one card per table.

### Printable kitchen ticket / receipt
Every order ticket, on both the customer and waiter side, has a Print
button. It builds a clean, minimal, monospace ticket in a hidden
print-only area and triggers the browser's print dialog — labelled
"KITCHEN TICKET" for an unpaid order or "RECEIPT" once it's paid,
matching what a restaurant would want to hand someone or stick on a
rail.

### Design escalation
The assignment specifically calls out that "design will make you stand
out," so beyond the base visual pass described under Visual Design in
Section 1 — real dish photography, a saturated color palette, motion —
the app also has a full dark mode, torn-paper ticket edges, and a
kitchen ticket rail that active orders visually hang from. None of it
was required; all of it was built and tested specifically because the
design itself was called out as something worth investing in.

## 5. How to Use It (Walkthrough)

1. Open the live link. You land on the Customer view.
2. There's a sun/moon icon at the top right — click it to switch
   between light and dark mode. Your choice is remembered on future
   visits.
3. Enter your name and a table number (any number — there's no real
   table registry).
4. Use the + / − buttons on any menu item to build an order. A bar
   appears at the bottom showing your item count and total.
5. Press Place Order. Your order appears under "Your orders" with a
   status of Placed and an estimated waiting time.
6. Click Waiter at the top right to switch roles (no login — this is a
   simple view switch, as the assignment allows).
7. Pick your name from "You are." Your new order appears at the top.
8. Press Assign to Me. A checklist appears — one row per item.
9. For each row, pick the chef (food items) or bartender (drink items)
   who prepared it, and press Record.
10. Once every row is checked off, press Mark Served.
11. Switch back to Customer — your ticket now shows Served, a Pay
    (Pretend) button, a star-rating form, and a complaint form. Use
    either, both, or neither.
12. Pressing Pay (Pretend) marks the order paid and moves it out of the
    waiter's active list into Settled Tonight.
13. Any ticket has a Print button (kitchen ticket before payment,
    receipt after) that opens your browser's print dialog with a
    clean, minimal version of the ticket.
14. While an order is still just placed, or assigned but untouched, its
    ticket also shows a Cancel Order button — the button disappears
    once prep has begun.
15. On the Floor screen, waiters can mark a dish sold out under Menu
    Availability (it disappears from the customer menu within a few
    seconds), see today's revenue/orders/top-seller/rating, and open a
    printable sheet of table QR codes — each one deep-links back to the
    ordering page with that table pre-filled.

---

## 6. How to Deploy It Yourself

Requires a free GitHub account, a free Neon account for Postgres, and a
free Render account for hosting. No card is needed for either.

1. Push the repository to GitHub (`git remote add origin`,
   `git push -u origin main`).
2. Create a Neon Postgres database and copy its connection string
   (starts with `postgres://` or `postgresql://`).
3. On Render: New → Blueprint → connect the GitHub repo. Render reads
   `render.yaml` automatically and proposes a web service called
   chowly. Paste the Neon connection string as the `DATABASE_URL`
   environment variable, then deploy.
4. Visit the URL Render provides. The first request creates the
   database tables and seeds the restaurant, menu, and staff
   automatically (see `app/seed.py`) — nothing else to run by hand.

If Render's free tier spins the service down after inactivity, the
first request after a while will just be slow (10–30 seconds) while it
wakes up — that's normal for a free-tier deploy and not a bug in the
app.
